/**

 *
 * <p><b>Accept now, work later.</b> {@code POST} answers {@code 202} immediately and hands the
 * application to {@link ApplicationService} — which does the work off the request thread and then
 * PUTs the outcome back to the orchestrator. Never do the work inside
 * {@link #processApplication}: the orchestrator is holding a connection open, and a module that
 * blocks turns a fast journey into a slow one.</p>
 *
 * <p>Add the endpoints your operator screen needs — a search, a manual override, a detail lookup —
 * here or in a new controller. Leave the {@code POST} alone: its shape is the contract.</p>
